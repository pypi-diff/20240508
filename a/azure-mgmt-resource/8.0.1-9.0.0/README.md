 **General Breaking changes**
 
-This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes if you were importing from the v20xx_yy_zz API folders.
-In summary, some modules were incorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in the first place.
-
-The following applies for all client and namespaces, we take ResourceManagementClient and "resources" as example:
-- ResourceManagementClient cannot be imported from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.resource_management_client` anymore (import from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz` works like before)
-- ResourceManagementClientConfiguration import has been moved from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.resource_management_client` to `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz`
-- A model `MyClass` from a "models" sub-module cannot be imported anymore using `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.models.my_class` (import from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.models` works like before)

 **General Breaking changes**
 
-This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes.
-
-- Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments.
-  To keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the "*" syntax for keyword-only arguments.
-- Enum types now use the "str" mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.
-  While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important, and are documented here:
-  https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others
-  At a glance:
-
-  - "is" should not be used at all.
-  - "format" will return the string value, where "%s" string formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax should be prefered.
+This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*
+introduce breaking changes.
 
-- New Long Running Operation:
-
-  - Return type changes from `msrestazure.azure_operation.AzureOperationPoller` to `msrest.polling.LROPoller`. External API is the same.
-  - Return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.LROPoller`, regardless of the optional parameters used.
-  - The behavior has changed when using `raw=True`. Instead of returning the initial call result as `ClientRawResponse`,
-    without polling, now this returns an LROPoller. After polling, the final resource will be returned as a `ClientRawResponse`.
-  - New `polling` parameter. The default behavior is `Polling=True` which will poll using ARM algorithm. When `Polling=False`,
-    the response of the initial call will be returned without polling.
-  - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of `msrest.polling.PollingMethod`.
-  - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right away.

         **General Breaking changes**
         
-        This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes if you were importing from the v20xx_yy_zz API folders.
-        In summary, some modules were incorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in the first place.
-        
-        The following applies for all client and namespaces, we take ResourceManagementClient and "resources" as example:
-        - ResourceManagementClient cannot be imported from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.resource_management_client` anymore (import from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz` works like before)
-        - ResourceManagementClientConfiguration import has been moved from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.resource_management_client` to `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz`
-        - A model `MyClass` from a "models" sub-module cannot be imported anymore using `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.models.my_class` (import from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.models` works like before)
-        - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations` sub-module cannot be imported anymore using `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.operations.my_class_operations` (import from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.operations` works like before)

+        first place.
+        
+        The following applies for all client and namespaces, we take
+        ResourceManagementClient and "resources" as example: -
+        ResourceManagementClient cannot be imported from
+        `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.resource_management_client`
+        anymore (import from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz`
+        works like before) - ResourceManagementClientConfiguration import has
+        been moved from
+        `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.resource_management_client`
+        to `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz` - A model `MyClass`
+        from a "models" sub-module cannot be imported anymore using
+        `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.models.my_class` (import
+        from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.models` works like
+        before) - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an
+        `operations` sub-module cannot be imported anymore using
+        `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.operations.my_class_operations`
+        (import from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.operations`
+        works like before)
+        
+        Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.
+        You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or
+        use no more than one client per process.

         **General Breaking changes**
         
-        This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes.
-        
-        - Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments.
-          To keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the "*" syntax for keyword-only arguments.
-        - Enum types now use the "str" mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.
-          While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important, and are documented here:
-          https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others
-          At a glance:
-        
-          - "is" should not be used at all.
-          - "format" will return the string value, where "%s" string formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax should be prefered.
+        This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*
+        introduce breaking changes.
         
-        - New Long Running Operation:
-        
-          - Return type changes from `msrestazure.azure_operation.AzureOperationPoller` to `msrest.polling.LROPoller`. External API is the same.
-          - Return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.LROPoller`, regardless of the optional parameters used.
-          - The behavior has changed when using `raw=True`. Instead of returning the initial call result as `ClientRawResponse`,
-            without polling, now this returns an LROPoller. After polling, the final resource will be returned as a `ClientRawResponse`.
-          - New `polling` parameter. The default behavior is `Polling=True` which will poll using ARM algorithm. When `Polling=False`,
-            the response of the initial call will be returned without polling.
-          - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of `msrest.polling.PollingMethod`.
-          - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right away.

         **General Breaking changes**
         
-        This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes if you were importing from the v20xx_yy_zz API folders.
-        In summary, some modules were incorrectly visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issues caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in the first place.

-        The following applies for all client and namespaces, we take ResourceManagementClient and "resources" as example:
-        - ResourceManagementClient cannot be imported from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz.resource_management_client` anymore (import from `azure.mgmt.resource.resources.v20xx_yy_zz` works like before)

         **General Breaking changes**
         
-        This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might* introduce breaking changes.
-        
-        - Model signatures now use only keyword-argument syntax. All positional arguments must be re-written as keyword-arguments.
-          To keep auto-completion in most cases, models are now generated for Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 uses the "*" syntax for keyword-only arguments.
-        - Enum types now use the "str" mixin (class AzureEnum(str, Enum)) to improve the behavior when unrecognized enum values are encountered.
-          While this is not a breaking change, the distinctions are important, and are documented here:
-          https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#others
-          At a glance:
-        
-          - "is" should not be used at all.
-          - "format" will return the string value, where "%s" string formatting will return `NameOfEnum.stringvalue`. Format syntax should be prefered.
+        This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*

-        - New Long Running Operation:
-        
-          - Return type changes from `msrestazure.azure_operation.AzureOperationPoller` to `msrest.polling.LROPoller`. External API is the same.
-          - Return type is now **always** a `msrest.polling.LROPoller`, regardless of the optional parameters used.
-          - The behavior has changed when using `raw=True`. Instead of returning the initial call result as `ClientRawResponse`,
-            without polling, now this returns an LROPoller. After polling, the final resource will be returned as a `ClientRawResponse`.
-          - New `polling` parameter. The default behavior is `Polling=True` which will poll using ARM algorithm. When `Polling=False`,
-            the response of the initial call will be returned without polling.
-          - `polling` parameter accepts instances of subclasses of `msrest.polling.PollingMethod`.
-          - `add_done_callback` will no longer raise if called after polling is finished, but will instead execute the callback right away.

-          However, we don't upgrade the  major version of the package, since this parameter has no meaning
-          for the RestAPI and there is no way any Python users would have been able to use it anyway.
